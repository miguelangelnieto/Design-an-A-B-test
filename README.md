# Design an A/B test

Part of the [**Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.**](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

Designed an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. I also analyzed the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity, recommended a decision, and proposed a follow-up experiment.
